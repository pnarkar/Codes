 <p><h1>Admission</h1>
<p>Stanford students come from across the United States and throughout the world, 
<p>representing diverse perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and cultures. U.S. 
<p>undergraduate applicants are admitted on a need-blind basis, and the university
<p> offers substantial financial aid to help families manage the costs. 
<p> Once here, Stanford students discover extraordinary freedom of opportunity â€” to explore, to collaborate and to challenge themselves.</p>
